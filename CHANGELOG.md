## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Jobs that reference more than one webhook (e.g. `ofelia.job-exec.<name>.webhooks: "wh-success, wh-error"`) now actually fire every listed webhook. `core.middlewareContainer.Use()` deduplicates by reflect type, so handing it two `*middlewares.Webhook` instances kept only the first one and silently dropped the rest — leaving the second webhook (typically the error-trigger one) attached to nothing and never invoked. All five per-job `buildMiddlewares` paths (`ExecJobConfig`, `RunJobConfig`, `LocalJobConfig`, `ComposeJobConfig`, `RunServiceConfig`) and the global `buildSchedulerMiddlewares` path now wrap the resolved webhook middlewares in `middlewares.NewWebhookMiddleware`, which exposes a single composite to `Use()` and dispatches to every inner webhook at run time. The previously-silent `wm.GetMiddlewares` error path (unknown webhook name, preset-load failure, missing required variable) now emits a `slog.Error` instead of swallowing the failure, so misconfigured webhooks are visible in the log. ([#670](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/670))

## [0.25.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- `tcp+tls://` is back on the `DOCKER_HOST` allow-list now that the TLS plumbing from [#613](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/613) wires `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` / `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` (and the equivalent `ClientConfig.TLSCertPath` / `TLSVerify` overrides) into the custom HTTP transport. PR [#612](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/612) had withheld it to avoid a silent plain-TCP downgrade; that risk is now closed by the existing `TestCreateHTTPClient_TCPPlusTLSEnablesTLS` regression test plus the new `TestNewClientWithConfig_TCPPlusTLSScheme` allow-list assertion. ([#625](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/625), fixes [#616](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/616))

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `DOCKER_HOST` scheme is now validated against an allow-list (`unix://`, `tcp://`, `tcp+tls://`, `http://`, `https://`, `npipe://`) and normalized to lowercase. Unsupported schemes (`ssh://`, `fd://`, bogus values) now fail at startup with a clear error instead of silently falling through to a plain-TCP transport. Fixes case-sensitivity bug for `TCP://` / `UNIX://`. Configurations that previously relied on the silent fallthrough will now fail loudly — operators using `ssh://` should switch to an SSH-forwarded socket and point `DOCKER_HOST` at the forwarded `unix://` path. ([#612](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/612), fixes [#609](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/609))
- Webhook global config now lives at a single source of truth: `c.WebhookConfigs.Global` aliases `&c.Global.WebhookGlobalConfig`, eliminating the dual-store antipattern that PR [#618](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/618) papered over with a hand-rolled `syncGlobalWebhookConfig` copy. Every entry point that mutates the embedded struct from the INI side (initial INI parse, INI live-reload) is automatically visible to `WebhookManager` without an explicit sync call. INI live-reload of `webhook-allowed-hosts` now also re-runs `WebhookManager.InitManager()` so the URL validator picks up the new whitelist at runtime — previously the data store was refreshed but the security validator stayed snapshotted at startup, so tightening the whitelist via live-reload had no enforcement effect until restart. The Docker label sync path still parses into a scratch Config and merges back via `mergeWebhookConfigs`/`syncWebhookConfigs`, which only forward the `webhook-webhooks` selector and per-webhook definitions — see follow-up. ([#620](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/620))
- `PresetLoader` now caches a single `*http.Client` (constructed in `NewPresetLoader` from `TransportFactory()`) instead of building a fresh client and `*http.Transport` on every `loadFromURL` call. Bursty preset fetches now share the underlying connection pool / idle-conn reuse. Test ordering constraint: tests overriding the transport factory via `SetTransportFactoryForTest` MUST install the override BEFORE calling `NewPresetLoader` — replacing the factory afterwards has no effect on the cached client. The deprecated Slack middleware (`middlewares/slack.go`) also routes its fallback `*http.Client` through `TransportFactory()` so notifications inherit the webhook stack's TLS / proxy posture instead of `http.DefaultTransport`; defense-in-depth for the deprecation window. ([#630](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/630))

### Deprecated

- Docker label key `ofelia.webhooks` is renamed to `ofelia.webhook-webhooks` to match the documented INI `[global]` key name. A user copying their INI `webhook-webhooks` value verbatim into Docker labels previously hit an "Unknown global label keys" warning and silently lost the value. The legacy `ofelia.webhooks` form still works for backward compatibility but logs a one-shot deprecation warning per process — migrate to `ofelia.webhook-webhooks` before the next major release. The other unprefixed legacy forms (`ofelia.allow-remote-presets`, `ofelia.trusted-preset-sources`, `ofelia.preset-cache-ttl`, `ofelia.preset-cache-dir`) were never accepted from labels because their canonical forms remain INI-only for SSRF reasons (see [#486](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/486)). ([#620](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/620))

  **Before:**
  ```yaml
  labels:
    ofelia.webhooks: "slack-alerts"  # legacy — emits one-shot deprecation warning
  ```

  **After:**
  ```yaml
  labels:
    ofelia.webhook-webhooks: "slack-alerts"  # canonical — matches INI [global]
  ```

### Security

- Go toolchain bumped from 1.26.2 to 1.26.3, clearing six standard-library advisories that `govulncheck` reaches from this codebase: [GO-2026-4986](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-4986) and [GO-2026-4977](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-4977) (`net/mail`), [GO-2026-4982](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-4982) and [GO-2026-4980](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-4980) (`html/template`), [GO-2026-4971](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-4971) (`net`), [GO-2026-4918](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-4918) (`net/http`). Direct deps refreshed in lockstep: `docker/cli` 29.4.2→29.4.3, `golang.org/x/crypto` 0.50→0.51, `golang.org/x/term` 0.42→0.43, `golang.org/x/text` 0.36→0.37, plus a full indirect-graph refresh via `go get -u all`. Post-bump, only two `govulncheck` findings remain — the unfixable upstream moby advisories [GO-2026-4887](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-4887) (AuthZ plugin bypass) and [GO-2026-4883](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-4883) (plugin-privilege off-by-one) on `docker/docker` v28.5.2, both reachable only via `init()` chains and with no upstream patch yet. Includes a small test-only fix to `TestSDKDockerProviderWaitContainerContextCanceled` to de-race the mock so go1.26.3's scheduler timing doesn't surface the preexisting `select` race between `<-ctx.Done()` and `<-respCh` (closed). ([#662](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/662))
- Docker SDK adapter now fails closed when `DOCKER_HOST=https://...` is set with TLS material configured (`DOCKER_CERT_PATH` env or `ClientConfig.TLSCertPath`) but the cert material at the configured path is unreadable or invalid (typo, missing files, broken volume mount, secrets not yet populated). Previously `applyDockerTLS` emitted a `slog.Warn` and left `TLSClientConfig` nil; the SDK then dialed with Go's default TLS — system CA pool, **no** client cert — silently downgrading the operator's declared mTLS into an unauthenticated TLS handshake. The new typed sentinel `ErrHTTPSRequiresUsableCertMaterial` makes the misconfiguration loud at startup. Asymmetry vs `tcp+tls://`: `https://` *without* any TLS material configured remains fail-open (operator legitimately uses the system CA bundle); only the misconfigured-material case fails. The warn-and-continue in `applyDockerTLS` remains as defense-in-depth for direct `createHTTPClient` callers (tests). ([#653](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/653), follow-up to [#646](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/646))
- SMTP middleware (`middlewares/mail.go`) now defaults to `MandatoryStartTLS` instead of inheriting go-mail's `OpportunisticStartTLS`. The previous default silently sent SMTP credentials and message body in cleartext when the server did not advertise STARTTLS — even when `smtp-tls-skip-verify = false` — violating the operator's intent. New `smtp-tls-policy` INI key accepts `mandatory` (default), `opportunistic`, or `none`; unknown values are normalized to `mandatory` and a `WARN`-level log line is emitted (defensive enum handling: a typo cannot weaken transport security). **BREAKING:** operators whose SMTP servers do not advertise STARTTLS (legacy local relays, MailHog dev fixtures) will see send failures after upgrade — set `smtp-tls-policy = opportunistic` (trusted-loopback paths) or `smtp-tls-policy = none` (test fixtures only) to restore the previous behavior. See `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for migration recipes. ([#653](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/653))
- Webhook URL allow-list now emits a single startup-time `WARN` when the resolved `webhook-allowed-hosts` admits all hosts (empty / unset / contains `*`). Previously a typo in the INI key collapsed silently into the `["*"]` default, yielding wide-open egress with no operator-visible signal that the allow-list they thought they had configured was actually empty. The warning fires once from `SetGlobalSecurityConfig` (the documented startup seam called from `NewWebhookManager`) — not per request — and includes a hint at the corrective INI key plus a link to the issue. No behavior change for operators who intentionally run wide-open egress; the warning is recoverable noise that documents the security posture in the log. ([#653](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/653))
- Remote preset fetches (`webhook-allow-remote-presets = true`) now route through the same `TransportFactory()` used by the webhook stack instead of `http.DefaultClient`. The previous code relied implicitly on Go stdlib defaults for TLS verification — safe today, but untested and easy to regress if a future change mutates `http.DefaultTransport`. The TLS posture is now explicit, centrally configurable alongside webhook delivery, and pinned by regression tests (self-signed cert rejection + `InsecureSkipVerify` posture check). No behavior change for operators on default config. ([#615](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/615))
- Docker SDK adapter now honors `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` and `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` for HTTPS / `tcp+tls` hosts. The custom HTTP client previously replaced the SDK's `FromEnv`-configured TLS transport wholesale, silently discarding the client cert and pinned CA. Connections to mTLS-protected Docker daemons proceeded without a client cert and against the system CA pool — operators believing they had mTLS were getting unauthenticated connections. New `ClientConfig.TLSCertPath` / `TLSVerify` fields allow explicit override with config > env precedence. **Upgrade impact:** if your `https://` Docker daemon previously accepted Ofelia connections without verifying client certs, upgrading will cause the dial to fail until valid `ca.pem` / `cert.pem` / `key.pem` exist at `DOCKER_CERT_PATH`. ([#613](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/613), fixes [#607](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/607))
- Docker SDK adapter now fails closed when `DOCKER_HOST=tcp+tls://...` is set without TLS material (`DOCKER_CERT_PATH` / `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` env vars or `ClientConfig.TLSCertPath` / `TLSVerify` overrides). Previously `resolveTLSConfig` returned `(nil, nil)` and the SDK dialed TLS using Go's stdlib defaults — system CA bundle, **no** client cert — silently downgrading the operator's declared mTLS into an unauthenticated TLS handshake against any daemon that did not strictly require client auth. `tcp+tls://` is an *explicit* TLS opt-in (unlike the ambiguous `tcp://`), so the new typed sentinel `ErrTCPTLSRequiresCertMaterial` makes the misconfiguration loud at startup rather than silent at runtime. `tcp://` and `https://` remain fail-open. **Upgrade impact:** if you set `DOCKER_HOST=tcp+tls://...` without configuring TLS material, Ofelia will now refuse to start — set `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` (and optionally `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY`) to a directory containing readable `ca.pem` / `cert.pem` / `key.pem`, or switch to `https://` if you genuinely want fail-open-with-warning. ([#627](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/627), surfaced during review of [#625](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/625))

### Fixed

- `MaxRuntime` cancellation now stops *and removes* the container or swarm service that was running, instead of leaving an orphaned process behind. [#651](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/651) wired a wrapper-level deadline so the inner SDK calls returned when the deadline fired, but the deferred `deleteContainer` reused the already-cancelled parent context — so the stop/remove API calls were rejected before they reached the daemon. The cleanup path now uses a fresh `context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), jobCleanupTimeout)` (`jobCleanupTimeout = 30s`) so stop/remove still runs after the parent deadline fires, and the same fix applies to `RunServiceJob`'s service teardown. Operators previously seeing `Exited` containers piling up after every MaxRuntime-bounded job should see them properly removed after this release. ([#659](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/659), fixes [#655](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/655), follow-up to [#651](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/651) / [#638](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/638))
- Docker label `[global]` keys outside the webhook subsystem now actually reach the live `c.Global` instead of being silently dropped. Setting e.g. `ofelia.smtp-host=mail.example.com` on a service container previously decoded into a scratch `Config.Global` that `mergeJobsFromDockerContainers` (boot) and `dockerContainersUpdate` (reconcile) discarded after the per-job / webhook merge — `mergeMailDefaults` then inherited the unchanged INI defaults so jobs saw empty SMTP with no warning. New per-subsystem helpers (`mergeSlackGlobals`, `mergeMailGlobals`, `mergeSaveGlobals`, `mergeSchedulingGlobals`) plus the `applyAllowListedGlobals` aggregator wire every allow-listed non-webhook global (Slack, Mail, Save, `log-level`, `max-runtime`, `notification-cooldown`, `enable-strict-validation`) through both call sites with the same "INI value wins when set; label only fills empty/default" precedence as `mergeWebhookGlobals` from [#650](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/650). Plain-bool fields (`SMTPTLSSkipVerify`, `EnableStrictValidation`) keep `mergeMailDefaults`' documented asymmetric policy: a label may UPGRADE false→true but cannot downgrade. Runtime label changes to `log-level` and `notification-cooldown` now also re-apply the process-wide knobs (`ApplyLogLevel`, `initNotificationDedup`) without a daemon restart. **Documented limitation** (matches existing INI live-reload behavior, out of scope for this fix): jobs whose own labels did not change in a reconcile pass keep their previously-inherited per-job middleware values until the next per-job change or restart — `mergeNotificationDefaults` only fills empty fields, so once inherited from the previous global, the per-job copy will not re-inherit. ([#652](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/652), sibling fix to [#650](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/650))
- `DOCKER_HOST=tcp://...` combined with `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` (or the equivalent `ClientConfig.TLSCertPath` override) now actually negotiates TLS end-to-end. Previously the custom HTTP transport was wired with TLS material via [#613](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/613), but the SDK kept the `tcp://` URL and Go's `http.Transport` only triggers TLS for `https://` URLs — so the cert material was silently unused and connections went out plaintext. `NewClientWithConfig` now mirrors the docker CLI's silent `tcp://` -> `https://` upgrade when TLS material is present, so the SDK and transport agree on the scheme and the configured certificate / pinned CA actually applies on the wire. Operators previously relying on `DOCKER_HOST=tcp://...` plus TLS env vars to reach an mTLS-protected daemon will now succeed instead of silently downgrading; operators who want plain TCP must omit `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` (or use explicit `tcp+tls://` for TLS). ([#634](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/634), follow-up to [#613](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/613))
- Docker API version negotiation at startup is now bounded by a configurable `NegotiateTimeout` (default 30s). Previously `NewClientWithConfig` called `NegotiateAPIVersion` with `context.Background()`, so a reachable-but-wedged Docker daemon (e.g. a socket proxy with a hung upstream) could hang Ofelia at startup with no diagnostic output. The deadline-exceeded path now logs a warning so operators can correlate startup slowness with daemon health ([#611](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/611), fixes [#608](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/608))
- Remaining unbounded Docker SDK calls are now wrapped in `context.WithTimeout`, so a reachable-but-wedged daemon can no longer stall the periodic `/health` and `/ready` checker (5s per call), the daemon startup sanity Pings in `NewDockerHandler` and `buildSDKProvider` (10s each, derived from the handler's own context so SIGINT during startup also cancels), or the `ofelia doctor` diagnostic (5s per Ping and per `HasImageLocally` call — per-call rather than overall to avoid falsely failing slow daemons with many images). `web/health.go` was the most visible regression because monitoring agents would never observe a non-2xx response when the daemon wedged. The three timeout values are unexported constants — see code comments for rationale; file an issue if your environment needs different bounds. Also adds `SDKDockerProviderConfig.NegotiateTimeout` to plumb the test-friendly negotiation bound from [#611](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/611) one layer up. ([#636](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/636), fixes [#614](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/614))
- `[global]` section now recognizes the documented `webhook-*` keys (`webhook-allow-remote-presets`, `webhook-preset-cache-ttl`, `webhook-trusted-preset-sources`, `webhook-preset-cache-dir`, `webhook-allowed-hosts`, `webhook-webhooks`) without emitting "Unknown configuration key" warnings, and the values are now applied to the webhook subsystem. Live-reload also re-syncs into `WebhookConfigs.Global` so runtime edits to `webhook-allowed-hosts` take effect without a restart. **Upgrade note:** if you previously used the unprefixed forms (`allow-remote-presets`, `webhooks`, `preset-cache-ttl`, etc.) under `[global]` — they were never documented but were tolerated by the old hand-rolled parser — rename them to the documented `webhook-*` form. The old keys now produce "Unknown configuration key" warnings and the values silently fall back to defaults. ([#618](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/618), fixes [#604](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/604))
- `DOCKER_HOST=tcp://...` now correctly drives the HTTP transport's dialer when `ClientConfig.Host` is empty. Previously the dialer was hard-pinned to `unix:///var/run/docker.sock` while the SDK was directed at the env-supplied TCP host, so every request silently routed to a non-existent unix socket and surfaced as a misleading "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at tcp://..." error. Most commonly hit with Docker socket proxies (e.g. tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy). The actual code change cascaded in via [#613](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/613); this entry documents the original report and adds the troubleshooting recipe. ([#606](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/606), fixes [#605](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/605))
- `ExecServiceAdapter.Create` and `.Run` no longer panic on a nil `ExecConfig` or on nil `stdout`/`stderr` writers in non-TTY mode. Both paths now return typed sentinel errors (`ErrNilExecConfig`, `ErrNoExecOutputWriter`) that callers can branch on via `errors.Is`. Previously the SDK would dereference the nil config (`config.User`, etc.) or `stdcopy.StdCopy` would panic on `(nil, nil)` writers when there was output to demultiplex. ([#619](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/619), refs [#610](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/610))
- Defense-in-depth: every public method on every `*ServiceAdapter` in `core/adapters/docker/` (`Container`, `Exec`, `Image`, `Event`, `Network`, `Swarm`, `System`) now returns the new sentinel `ErrNilDockerClient` instead of panicking with a nil-pointer dereference if the embedded SDK client is nil. The `newClientFromSDK` constructor always wires a non-nil client, so this is only reachable through hand-rolled adapter values (test fixtures or wiring bugs) — but the guards convert what would otherwise be a panic in a hot goroutine into a branchable, actionable failure. `Subscribe` and `Wait` (channel-returning) push the sentinel to `errCh` and close both channels synchronously without launching a goroutine. ([#639](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/639), fixes [#623](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/623))
- The Docker label sync path now mirrors the `WebhookConfigs.Global → &Global.WebhookGlobalConfig` pointer alias that `NewConfig` set up for the live config in [#637](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/637) / [#620](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/620). The scratch `Config` built by `dockerContainersUpdate` and `mergeJobsFromDockerContainers` previously used a struct literal with `WebhookConfigs: NewWebhookConfigs()`, which left `parsed.WebhookConfigs.Global` pointing at a fresh `*WebhookGlobalConfig` disjoint from `parsed.Global.WebhookGlobalConfig`. Any future `mergeWebhookConfigs` field that reads from the parsed `WebhookConfigs.Global` (notably the `PresetCacheTTL` forwarding planned in [#640](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/640)) would silently observe the 24h default instead of the just-decoded label value. Both call sites now go through a `newScratchConfig(c)` helper that re-establishes the alias. ([#641](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/641))
- Symmetric nil-guards on the *From* helpers in the Docker adapter: `convertFromSwarmService(nil)` returns nil, `convertTaskTemplateFromSwarm` is a no-op when either side is nil, `convertFromSwarmTask(nil)` returns the zero `domain.Task`, and `convertFromSDKEvent(nil)` returns the zero `domain.Event`. `ContainerServiceAdapter.Create` now returns the new typed sentinel `ErrNilContainerConfig` (errors.Is-branchable, mirrors `ErrNilExecConfig` from [#619](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/619)) instead of dereferencing `config.HostConfig` / `config.NetworkConfig` on a nil config. `convertFromSwarmTask`, `convertFromSDKEvent`, and `Container.Create`'s `HostConfig` deref are reachable through public API paths (the event-consumer goroutine, `WaitForServiceTasks`, the executor); `convertFromSwarmService` and `convertTaskTemplateFromSwarm` were latent (test-callable only) but guarded for symmetry with PR [#626](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/626). Same bug class as [#619](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/619) and [#626](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/626). The issue's mention of "nil `e.Actor`" was technically inaccurate — `events.Actor` is a value type, not a pointer, so only the outer `*events.Message` can be nil. ([#632](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/632), refs [#626](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/626) / [#622](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/622))
- Docker adapter convert helpers (`convertToSwarmSpec`, `convertTaskTemplateToSwarm`, `convertToMount`) now nil-guard their pointer arguments and return a zero value instead of panicking. Same bug class as #619 — the helpers dereferenced `spec`, `src`, and `m` without a nil-check. Production callers always pass a non-nil pointer today (so this is defense-in-depth, not a wild-fire fix), but the helper signatures invited unsafe direct calls from tests and refactors. ([#626](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/626), fixes [#622](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/622))
- Sibling-hunt completion of the `convert.go` family of nil-guard gaps: `convertFromAPIContainer(nil)` and `convertFromNetworkResource(nil)` return the zero `domain.Container` / `domain.Network`, `convertFromNetworkInspect(nil)` returns nil (mirroring `convertFromSwarmService` from [#648](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/648)), and `convertToMount(nil)` returns the zero `mount.Mount` — closing the asymmetry where every other `convertTo*` helper in `container.go` (`convertToHostConfig`, `convertToNetworkingConfig`, `convertToEndpointSettings`, `convertToContainerConfig`) already nil-guarded its argument and only `convertToMount` did not. All four are reached via `&loopVar` from a `range` over a slice in production, so no live panic exists today; this is defense-in-depth for unsafe signature contracts. Same bug class as [#619](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/619) / [#626](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/626) / [#632](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/632), completing what [#648](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/648) started. ([#654](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/654), refs [#648](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/648) / [#626](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/626))

### Tests

- Stabilize `TestHealthStatus` race against the `NewHealthChecker` background goroutine — build the `HealthChecker` directly in the test so the auto-injected `docker=Unhealthy` check cannot leak into the aggregated status before `GetHealth()` runs. ([#606](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/606))
- New `TestConfigGlobalKeysAreDocumented` walks the embedded middleware structs in `Config.Global` via reflection and asserts each `mapstructure` key is mentioned in at least one operator-facing docs file (`docs/CONFIGURATION.md`, `docs/webhooks.md`, `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md`, `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `README.md`). Catches the same drift class as #604 / #621 mechanically. ([#621](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/621))
- Per-handler unit tests for the Docker scheme dispatch table (`TestSchemeHandlers_ApplyDirect`) invoke each `apply*` function directly with a fresh `*http.Transport` and assert the per-scheme `ForceAttemptHTTP2` / `DialContext` shape. Catches a refactor that breaks one scheme without breaking the others — previously the `apply*` functions were only covered transitively. New `TestCreateHTTPClient_UnknownSchemeFallback` pins the defensive plain-HTTP/1.1 fallback for unrecognized schemes (production rejects upstream via `NewClientWithConfig`; this exercises the seam, not the production gate). Tightened `TestNewClientWithConfig_ReadsDOCKERHOSTOnce` `env_only` branch from `<= 1` to `== 1` so a regression that drops the env read entirely is caught. ([#633](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/633), follow-up to [#629](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/629))

### Documentation

- Reconcile the `tcp://` Docker host scheme docs with reality: the godoc in `core/adapters/docker/client.go` (the `schemeHandlers` table) and the scheme table in `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` previously claimed `tcp://` "auto-upgrades to TLS when `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` / `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` are set", mirroring the docker CLI. The transport-layer half of that upgrade was wired in [#613](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/613), but Go's `http.Transport` only performs TLS on `https://` URLs — so the `TLSClientConfig` was loaded with cert material that the SDK never offered on the wire. Operators following the docker CLI mental model believed they had mTLS while their connections went out as plain TCP. The fix removes the `applyDockerTLS` call from `applyTCPTransport` (silent ineffective wiring is worse than failing loud), updates the godoc and the troubleshooting table to point operators at `tcp+tls://` ([#616](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/616)) or `https://` for TLS over TCP, and replaces the misleading `TestCreateHTTPClient_TCPWithTLSEnvUpgrades` regression test with `TestCreateHTTPClient_TCPDoesNotWireTLSEvenWithEnv` to pin the contract going forward. The deeper docker-CLI parity story — automatic `tcp://` to `https://` URL rewriting at the SDK layer — is tracked separately in [#634](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/634) and intentionally not addressed here. ([#628](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/628))
- Reconcile **Slack** middleware key documentation with the actual struct fields in `middlewares.SlackConfig`. Removed the documented-but-rejected `slack-url` (typo for `slack-webhook`), `slack-channel`, `slack-mentions`, `slack-icon-emoji`, and `slack-username` keys from `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` and `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md`. The legacy Slack middleware (deprecated, scheduled for removal in v1.0.0) only accepts `slack-webhook` and `slack-only-on-error`; for channel routing, mentions, custom username/avatar, etc., migrate to a `[webhook "name"]` section with `preset = slack` ([webhook docs](docs/webhooks.md)). ([#621](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/621))
- Reconcile **Save** middleware key documentation with the actual struct fields in `middlewares.SaveConfig`. Documented the existing `restore-history` and `restore-history-max-age` global keys (supported by the parser but undocumented) and removed the unimplemented `save-format` and `save-retention` keys from `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`. ([#621](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/621))
- Document the previously-undocumented (or only partially-documented) `[global]` keys surfaced by the docs-vs-code drift sweep: `notification-cooldown` (notification deduplication window) and `smtp-tls-skip-verify` (with a dedicated security trade-off section in `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` covering when it's acceptable, when it's not, and recommended alternatives) in `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`; and the webhook globals `webhook-webhooks`, `webhook-trusted-preset-sources`, `webhook-preset-cache-dir`, plus an explicit INI-vs-Docker-labels callout (only `webhook-webhooks` is exposed via labels; the SSRF-sensitive globals are INI-only) in `docs/webhooks.md`. ([#635](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/635), refs [#621](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/621), [#604](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/604))
- Reconcile the README "Features" bullet and `OFELIA_POLL_INTERVAL` env-var row with the post-[#586](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/586) split-poll-interval contract: container detection now defaults to Docker events (`--docker-events=true` is the only CLI flag in this group). The other three knobs are INI-only — `docker-poll-interval` (opt-in container polling), `polling-fallback` (default `10s`, auto-engages polling if the event stream fails), and `config-poll-interval` (default `10s`, drives INI file reloads). The legacy `--docker-poll-interval` CLI flag stays for backward compatibility but now sets the deprecated unified `Config.Docker.PollInterval`, which `ApplyDeprecationMigrations` splits into the new INI keys at parse time. The `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md` polling-defaults diagram is swapped to match — Events are default-on, Poll is opt-in, polling-fallback is shown as the third edge. Also documents the previously-undocumented `web-trusted-proxies` global key in `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` with a security note covering the X-Forwarded-For spoofing risk if the CIDR list is too permissive (sibling-hunt finding from PR [#645](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/645)). The `TestConfigGlobalKeysAreDocumented` drift detector is extended to walk direct (non-anonymous) `Config.Global` fields too, closing the `TODO(#635)` so future undocumented direct keys (not just embedded middleware config keys) are caught mechanically. ([#656](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/656), refs [#644](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/644), [#645](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/645), [#586](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/586), [#635](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/635))

### Refactor

- Unify Docker host / scheme resolution in `core/adapters/docker/client.go` into a single `resolveDockerHost` seam. `NewClientWithConfig` and `createHTTPClient` now agree on the resolved host without re-reading `DOCKER_HOST`, eliminating the dual-reader anti-pattern that produced [#605](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/605) / [#607](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/607) / [#609](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/609). The dispatch `switch` and the separate `supportedDockerHostSchemes` slice collapsed into a single `schemeHandlers` map (allow-list + dispatch derived from the same data); scheme spelling lives in named constants; `formatSupportedSchemes` is cached in a package var. `client.FromEnv` is dropped from the SDK options chain (host + TLS are mirrored explicitly; `DOCKER_API_VERSION` is preserved via `client.WithVersionFromEnv()`). New contract test asserts `DOCKER_HOST` is read at most once per `NewClientWithConfig` call; new parity test asserts the public allow-list cannot drift from the dispatch table. Pure refactor with one minor operator-visible side effect: the `unsupported DOCKER_HOST scheme` error now lists the supported schemes in alphabetical order (`http://, https://, npipe://, tcp://, unix://`) rather than the previous curated `unix, tcp, http, https, npipe` order — the new map-derived list sorts deterministically. ([#617](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/issues/617))

## [0.24.0] - 2026-05-10

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Docker Compose service-name based job naming now works as documented. The `com.docker.compose.service` label is no longer filtered out, so the `Cross-Container Job References (Docker Compose)` feature from `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` is functional. Users who relied on the previous (incorrect) job names may see different names. ([#597](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/pull/597))

### Added
